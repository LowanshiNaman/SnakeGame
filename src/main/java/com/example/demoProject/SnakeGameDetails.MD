Data Structures and Design Patterns for a Snake Game
Data Structures
ArrayList<Point> for Snake Body:

Purpose: Represents the snake's body as a series of coordinates.
Operations: Efficiently handles dynamic changes to the snake's length, including adding new segments and removing the tail.
Point for Snake and Fruit Position:

Purpose: Stores the coordinates for the snake's head, tail, and fruit.
Operations: Facilitates comparison and manipulation of positions.
Timer for Game Loop:

Purpose: Provides a periodic update mechanism for the game state and screen rendering.
Operations: Executes game updates at regular intervals.
JFrame and Graphics for Rendering:

Purpose: Manages the game window and drawing operations.
Operations: Handles drawing the snake, fruit, and game state updates.
Design Patterns
Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern:

Model: Manages game data and logic (e.g., SnakeGame class).
View: Renders game objects on the screen (e.g., using JFrame and Graphics).
Controller: Handles user input and updates the game state (e.g., KeyAdapter for keyboard input).
Observer Pattern:

Purpose: Allows the Timer to periodically trigger game updates by observing the game state.
Usage: Timer calls the actionPerformed method to update the game state.
Strategy Pattern (Implicit):

Purpose: Manages different movement directions for the snake.
Usage: Direction-based logic in the moveSnake() method changes how the snake's position is updated.
Singleton Pattern:

Purpose: Ensures a single instance of the game window is created.
Usage: The SnakeGame class typically represents a single game instance.
Factory Pattern (Potential Enhancement):

Purpose: Creates different game objects (e.g., different fruit types).
Usage: Could be implemented to generate various types of game objects dynamically.
This structured format provides a clear overview of the data structures and design patterns used in the Snake game implementation.
